# Eyes
This project uses html, javascript, and css to create a pair of eyes that follow the mouse's movements.  The javascript code updates the eyes' positions every time it captures movement from the mouse.
## How To Run
To run this eyes project, ensure index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css are together in one directory.  Open the index.html file in a browser.  Then, move your mouse within the browser window.  You should see the eyes following your mouse.
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Improvements might include more insctructions for the user, additonal facial features in the design, and a background color that responds the mouse position.
